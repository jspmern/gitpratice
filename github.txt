                       ----There is three stage in git Hub---
...........................................................................................................................................
1.modified  = in the modified phase, if you want undo all change (git restore first.html)

2.staged = in the staged phase, if you want to undo all change  (git restore --staged first.html) after the undo it goes to again 

3.modified  =  in the modified phase (after the commit ), if you want to undo all change  so we have two option
             soft -This is useful when you want to "undo" the commits but keep the changes staged for a new commit (git reset --soft HEAD~1)
            hard-This is useful when you want to completely discard the changes in the working directory and start fresh with the state of the specified commit  (git reset --hard HEAD~1)



......................................Branches..............................................
.check branch you are working-
        git branch
.create new branch -
        git branch branch_name
.switch to a branch -
        git checkout branch_name
.create and switch together -
        git checkout -b new_branch_name
.Delete branch -
        git branch -D branch_name (but if you want to Delete your branch in same branch , it is not possible you have to go onothe branch than possible) 
.Change brach Name- if you want to chage the brach name it is possible (git branch -m new_branch_name) 
.Push your code in own brach - git push -u origin your_branch_name 
.merge two brach - first you have to comeout to the branch with you merge , after that you have to  hit git merge brach_name(that you want to merge ) and if you want to see the change in github for that you have to push the code form your cmd

Note point- change is availble for specified branch if you want to see same changes in otherbranch then you have to do merge   
            here one senrio , if you do change is in branch from that branch without save if you want to jump another brach then you are getting one error is {commit your change or stash them before you switch branches}
